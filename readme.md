# Artclass Site

Artclass is a place were you can get your mind off school and relax. We all know about the school restrictions on our chromebooks. Here we have games, proxies, and tools to have fun and make your teachers mad that they can't see your screen.

## Tools:

### Tailwind CSS

In this project we are using Tailwind css for minimal css code and to easily use utility classes in our project. It can be found in the `index.html` in the `public` folder ```<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>.

### Alpine.js
